Preparation
===========

Before we get started, there are a couple of prerequisites to take care of first.

.. _preparation-InstallingOpenCOR:

Install OpenCOR
---------------

This tutorial requires a reasonably new version of OpenCOR to be used. Specifically, we use here *OpenCOR Snapshot 2017-06-21*. That or any new version of OpenCOR should work fine. OpenCOR can be downloaded from: http://opencor.ws/downloads/index.html. The tutors also have copies of the installers available.

.. _preparation-pmrAccount:

Connecting OpenCOR to your PMR account
--------------------------------------

Once you have OpenCOR installed, we want to connect it to PMR to enable you to archive and share your work. If you follow the instructions over at :ref:`cellml_opencor_pmr_tutorial__pmr_with_opencor` to create an account on the teaching instance of the Physiome Model Repository (PMR) and then set up OpenCOR to use that account.
