Preparation
===========

Before we get started, there are a couple of prerequisites to take care of first.

.. _preparation-InstallingOpenCOR:

Install OpenCOR
---------------

This tutorial requires a reasonably new version of OpenCOR to be used. Specifically, we use here *OpenCOR Snapshot 2017-06-21*. That or any new version of OpenCOR should work fine. OpenCOR can be downloaded from: http://opencor.ws/downloads/index.html. The tutors also have copies of the installers available.

.. _preparation-pmrAccount:

Create a PMR Account
--------------------

In this tutorial we use the teaching instance of the Physiome Model Repository (PMR). The teaching instance allows us to try out features and workflows without the worry of the permanence of the primary instance of the repository. Before we begin you first need to create an account to use in the teaching instance of PMR.

First, navigate to the teaching instance at `<http://teaching.physiomeproject.org/>`_. In order to make changes to models in the repository, you must
first register for an account.  Your account will have the appropriate access privileges so that you can push any changes you have made to a model back into the repository.

To register an account, access the *Log in* link and access the *registration form* from there. Enter your desired username and password. After completing the email validation step, you can now log in to the repository.

.. note::

   This username and password are also the credentials you use to
   interact with the repository via OpenCOR.

Once logged in to the repository, you will notice that there is a new link in the navigation bar, My Workspaces. This is where all the workspaces you create later on will be listed. The Log in link is also replaced by your username and a Log out link.
