Preparation
===========

Installing OpenCOR
------------------

This tutorial requires a reasonably new version of OpenCOR to be used. Specifically, we use here *OpenCOR Snapshot 2017-06-21*. That or any new version of OpenCOR should work fine. OpenCOR can be downloaded from: http://opencor.ws/downloads/index.html.
