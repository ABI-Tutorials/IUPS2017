VPH 2014 - ABI Software Tutorial
================================

This tutorial consists of two independent components that can be worked through in any order. One is the OpenCOR tutorial, which focuses on working with CellML models. The other is the MAP Client workflow tool focussing on moving data through a series of processing steps. Both of these are able to make use of the Auckland Physiome Repository to locate, archive, and share data.
