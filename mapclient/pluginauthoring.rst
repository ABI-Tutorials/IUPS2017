Creating your own step
----------------------

Is it step or plugin?

The purpose of this step is to demonstrate how to define your own step. This will probably be a link to the appropriate section in the MAP Client docs. Using a nice simple process enables the user to intuitively know what output to expect for a given input so it makes it easy for them to play with things, predict the outcome, and check the actual outcome matches their prediction.

As well as linking to the docs for the standard how to create a step, be sure to encourage them to look into the source for the steps used in the tasks above - which are all available somewhere...
