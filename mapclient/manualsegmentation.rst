.. _mapclient-manualseg:

Manually digitising an image stack
----------------------------------

The purpose of this task is to demonstrate the coolest step that currently exists for the MAP Client and to highlight the reusable nature of the plugins/steps. Be sure to reference the github collection of steps that is being populated and the idea that people should contribute their steps even if they think they are specific to their own work.

#. Configure the image stack to load
#. Bring up the manual digitisation editor

   * Probably need to provide enough detail that people will be able to use it, possibly link to the relevant documentation in the MAP Client docs?
   
#. Digitise some points
#. Explain how to load up some points that have already been defined (like wow!)
#. Digitise some more points
#. Handover to the output to text file step.
#. and the visualise in Zinc step
#. Explain how those two output steps are identical to those from the previous task and talk about step-reuse, sharing knowledge, reproducibility, etc.
