Introducing the *Physiome* journal
==================================

*Physiome* publishes reproducible and reusable mathematical models of physiological processes where the experimental details and model validation have been published or accepted for publication in a recognised 'primary' peer-reviewed journal. *Physiome* is open access with a low Author Processing Charge. Where possible, models can be displayed (in mathematical form and in various programming languages) and run directly from the journal website with freely available open source software.

*Physiome* can be found online at `journal.physiomeproject.org <https://journal.physiomeproject.org>`_.

Figshare publication platform
-----------------------------

*Physiome* makes use of the `Figshare <https://figshare.com/>`_ platform in two ways. The first is that Figshare is used to publish and distribute *Physiome* articles, ensuring each article has a persistent and resolvable `DOI <https://www.doi.org/>`_ (see `physiome.figshare.com <https://physiome.figshare.com>`_). This also enables the collection of various metrics tracking things like article views, downloads, social media mentions, etc. that will help us to provide an indication of the impact a model published in *Physiome* is having, in addition to the traditional impact measurements associated with the primary paper.

The second way Figshare is used is as the submission portal for authors to submit their work to *Physiome* for evaluation. The submission portal is available at: https://physiome.figshare.com/submit. See the `author instructions <https://journal.physiomeproject.org/instructions-to-authors.html>`_ for the details on creating and submitting your work to *Physiome*.

*Physiome* articles
-------------------

Articles published in *Physiome* consist of two items, both available via the Figshare platform. The first is a PDF document describing the model, modelling assumptions, limitations, provenance, etc. The second is a `COMBINE archive <http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive>`_ file which contains all the model and simulation files required to produce the model predictions provided in the PDF, as well as those linked back to the primary paper.

The COMBINE archive has its own DOI provided by the Figshare platform and should be downloaded for use in desktop tools as the starting point for reusing an existing model that is relevant to your work. If the model requires the use of a tool or application which does not support COMBINE archives natively, the archive can by extracted using standard ZIP tools, which are natively supported on most operating systems.
