VPH 2014 - ABI Software Tutorial
================================

This is a collection of documentation covering software used within the
Auckland Bioengineering Institute (ABI). This includes software
developed internally and also other commonly used applications.  The
version of the book has been customised for the session, "VPH tools from
the Auckland Bioengineering Institute", which was presented at the `VPH
2014 <http://www.ntnu.edu/vph2014/>`_ meeting.

This tutorial makes use of two primary tools, OpenCOR and MAP Client, as well as the Auckland Physiome Repository. Documentation can be found for each of these collated here and corresponding to the versions used in the tutorial.
